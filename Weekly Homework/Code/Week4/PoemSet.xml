    <Stanza ID="A:1">
      <PoemLine>Whenever Richard Cory went down town,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>We people on the pavement looked at him;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>He was a gentleman from sole to crown,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Clean favored, and imperially slim.</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="A:2">
      <PoemLine>And he was always quietly arrayed,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>And he was always human when he talked;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>But still he fluttered pulses when he said,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>"Good-morning," and he glittered when he walked.</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="A:3">
      <PoemLine>And he was rich - yes, richer than a king,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>And admirably schooled in every grace;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>In fine, we thought that he was everything</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>To make us wish that we were in his place.</PoemLine>

    <PoemTitle>The Raven</PoemTitle>
    <PoemAuthor>Edgar Allan Poe</PoemAuthor>
    <Stanza ID="C:1">
      <PoemLine>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Only this and nothing more.”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:2">
      <PoemLine>    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Nameless here for evermore.</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:3">
      <PoemLine>    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            This it is and nothing more.”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:4">
      <PoemLine>    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Darkness there and nothing more.</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:5">
      <PoemLine>    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Merely this and nothing more.</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:6">
      <PoemLine>    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:7">
      <PoemLine>    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:8">
      <PoemLine>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:9">
      <PoemLine>    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            With such name as “Nevermore.”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:10">
      <PoemLine>    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:11">
      <PoemLine>    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:12">
      <PoemLine>    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:13">
      <PoemLine>    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            She shall press, ah, nevermore!</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:14">
      <PoemLine>    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:15">
      <PoemLine>    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:16">
      <PoemLine>    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</PoemLine>
    </Stanza>
    <Stanza ID="C:17">
      <PoemLine>    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>    Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”</PoemLine>
      <PoemLine>            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</PoemLine>
